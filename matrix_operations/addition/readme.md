# Entrywise sum
Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be added. In which case, the sum of two matrices A and B will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as A and B. The sum of A and B, denoted A + B, is computed by adding corresponding elements of A and B:

Or more concisely (assuming that A + B = C):

Similarly, it is also possible to subtract one matrix from another, as long as they have the same dimensions. The difference of A and B, denoted A âˆ’ B, is computed by subtracting elements of B from corresponding elements of A, and has the same dimensions as A and B.
